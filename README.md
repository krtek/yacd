# Yet Another COVID-19 Dashboard

There are many, but this one is mine.

Should be short and to the point.

## What I'm tracking and why

* *Number of critical active cases in time* - Possible overwhelming of the healthcare system is probably the main concern. If # of active cases requiring intensive care rises quickly, we may actually get in trouble.
* *Reproduction number estimate* - an exponential spread is definitely an issue
* *Number of counties with new cases* - this should point how localized the outbreak is.
* *Ratio of news articles mentioning COVID* - COVID-19 is a lucrative topic. Media profit from the fear. This is probably more dangerous than the disease itself as it's a reinforcing factor in media-public-goverment loop, directly affecting everyday life and economics. 

## What I'm NOT tracking and why

* *Active cases, daily new cases* - heavily depends on testing, so is kind of arbitrary and may be misleading
* *Positive test results ration* - heavily biased by *who* gets tested and why = low value information
* *Deaths* - in most deaths COVID is not the primary cause, it is impossible to interpret this number
